## Description 
This application was developed collaborativelly using agile methodologies and project management tools to conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. Advanced HTML and CSS properties make up the structure and design. While third-party APIs powered by Javascript such as Bootstrap and jquery provided the primary functionality and responsiveness of our site. 

Two server-side APIs were used to retrieve, store, and display data on our site specifically pertaining to non-profit organizations and advocacy groups in the greater Columbus, OH area specialize in domestic abuse. 

APIs USED:

NonProfit Explorer: https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/

GuideStar: https://www.guidestar.org/


The intent of this project was to develop an innocuous website that provides helpful resources for men, women, and children in the Columbus area; while presenting itself as a thrift clothing website to prying eyes. This application runs in a web browser and features clothing on three separate pages. All sections of the website are accessible from the homepage providing a user experience that is inuititive and easy to use. Users can sign up from the homepage to find out more about our website. The sign up modal contains a Terms of Service agreement meant to deterr anyone from reading further. Click the check box to accept the Terms of Service and display a hidden element containing important information and instructions for using our site. Select from three different categories, each category displays a collection of apparel for shopping. At the bottom of each page, there is a search input for store locations. Enter the nearest zipcode and get search results for local domestic violance resources. Our hope is that users will find our website a secure place to seek help when they are unable to do so through other means. 



## USER STORY

As a user, I want a discreet website for victims of domestic violence to find local resources and support. 
When I visit the website, I'm presented with an innocuous online retail store that sells a variety of clothing. 
Then I scroll down to the bottom of the homepage and click the sign up button.
When I accept the terms of service, I'm provided with important information about the website.
Then I click one of the three menu options: Men's, Women's, Children's
When I view the page, I'm presented with different clothing items for each category. 
Then I can enter my zipcode at the bottom of each page. 
When I view the results, I'm provided with local resources disguised as retail store locations.
